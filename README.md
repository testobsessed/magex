magex: The Magical Commodity Exchange Server
=====

Magex is a trading platform to support programming competitions and classroom exercises. It consists of an http-based server that enables clients to buy and sell magical shares of magical items such as Wishing Wands and Flying Carpets. You can use this code base to run your own magical commodity exchange, or you can write a client to participate in our hosted exchange (site to be determined).

Here's what you need to know to write a client to execute trades on your behalf.
