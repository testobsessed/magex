magex: The Magical Commodity Exchange Server
=====

Magex is a trading platform to support programming competitions and classroom exercises. Commodities listed on the Magical Exchange include:

- Wishing Wands (wish)
- Flying Carpets (flyc)
- Singing Swords (sisw)
- Magic Beans (mbns)
- Pixie Dust Vials (pixd)

All trades are made in gold. Magex matches buy and sell orders to complete transactions. It also tracks market valuation for commodities traded on the market. You participate in the exchange by writing a client program against the Magex API to place your buy and sell orders.

You can use this code base to run your own magical commodity exchange, or you can write a client to participate in our hosted exchange (site to be determined).

The rest of this document explains what you need to know to write a client to execute trades on your behalf.
